# Lazy Evaluation

### Force Evaluation through Seq

### seq will always evaluate the first argument and return the second argument
```haskell
位> :t seq
seq :: a -> b -> b
```

#### foldl will evaluate at the very end 1 + (2 + (3 + 0)) remembering each expression as thunks
#### foldl' will force evaluate every step of the way not remembering any thunks through the use of seq
```haskell
位> :m +Data.List
位> foldl (+) 0 [1..3]      
6                         
it :: (Num b, Enum b) => b
位> foldl' (+) 0 [1..3]     
6                         
it :: (Num b, Enum b) => b
```

### foldl' expands as follows:
```haskell
let new = 1 + 2
in new `seq` foldl' (+) new [3]

let new = 3 + 3
in new `seq` foldl' (+) new []
```
